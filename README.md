# Predicting-Stock-Prices-using-Time-Series-analysis
This project focuses on building a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based deep learning model to predict stock prices using historical market data. The goal is to analyze past price movements and forecast future values, demonstrating the application of time series analysis in financial markets.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based deep learning model to predict stock prices using historical market data. The model analyzes past price movements and forecasts future values, showcasing the application of time series analysis in financial markets.

## 📊 Dataset
Historical stock price data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).
Data preprocessed with normalization, train-test split, and sequence generation for LSTM input.
Example dataset: Apple Stock Price Data (AAPL).

## 🚀 Features
Data preprocessing and feature scaling for time series analysis.
LSTM-based deep learning model for sequential data.
Model evaluation using RMSE and prediction visualization.
Comparison between actual vs. predicted stock prices.
Potential for extension to multiple stocks or indices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
TensorFlow / Keras (Deep Learning – LSTM)
Matplotlib (Visualization)
Jupyter Notebook / Spyder (Development Environment)

## 📈 Results
The LSTM model was able to capture stock price trends and forecast future values.
Predictions closely follow actual stock price movements.
Visualization shows model effectiveness in short-term forecasting.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
Incorporate additional features such as technical indicators, news sentiment, and macroeconomic data.
Use advanced architectures like GRU, Bidirectional LSTM, or Transformers.
Deploy as a dashboard/web app for real-time stock predictions.
